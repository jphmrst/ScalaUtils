Various utilities, organized into several packages.

=Structured text and formatted output=

 - [[org.maraist.graphviz]] - Bindings to the GraphViz utility for
   rendering graphs.
   
 - [[org.maraist.html]] - Describing the formatting of objects as HTML
   with a {@code toHTML} method analogous to {@code toString}.  Really
   just two traits at this point.
 
 - [[org.maraist.latex]] - Describing the formatting of objects as
   LaTeX with a {@code toLaTeX} method analogous to {@code toString}.
 
 - [[org.maraist.outlines]] - A simple model of text structured as
   nested outlines.
   
=Search algorithms=

Implementations of selected algorithms from Russell and Norvig's text.
Most algorithm-implementing classes are structured so that behavior
can be customized via constructor arguments.

 - [[org.maraist.search.graph]] - Graph search algorithms including A*
   and BFS.
   
 - [[org.maraist.search.local]] - Local search algorithms including
   beam search and stochastic beam search.
   
 - [[org.maraist.search.csp]] - Algorithms for search-based solutions
   to constraint-solving problems.
   
 - [[org.maraist.search]] - Umbrella package for common generalizing
   traits and exceptions.
 
=Automata=
 
 - [[org.maraist.fa]] - Finite automata and various extensions, most
   including implementations of Rabin-Scott where appropriate for
   conversion from nondeterministic to deterministic representations.
